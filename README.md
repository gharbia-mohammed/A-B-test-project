# A-B-test-project


### Project Overview
This project analyzes using A/B test to evaluate whether offering discounts increases the average order value (AOV).

Two groups of customers were compared:
1-customers who saw regular prices (Control group)
2- customers who received a 15% discount (Discount group)

Using Python and statistical testing, we examine whether the discount campaign led to a statistically significant difference in customer spending.



### Dataset Description :
The dataset contains  purchase data from 100 customers collected over a one-week promotional campaign.
customer_id : Unique identifier for each customer
group : Control or Discount
orders_count: Number of orders placed by the customer
total_spent : Total amount (USD) the customer spent during the week



### Tools & Libraries Used :
 
Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Statistical Methods:
Shapiro‚ÄìWilk Test (Normality)
Levene‚Äôs Test (Equality of Variances)
Independent Samples t-test (Main Analysis)



### Hypotheses :

Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):
There is no significant difference in the average order value between the Control and Discount groups.

Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):
There is a significant difference in the average order value between the Control and Discount groups.



üßÆ Analysis Steps


















### Results / findings :

 1. With a contribution of 60%, Office Supplies ranked as the top sales category.
 2. Office Supplies recorded the highest profit among all categories, totaling approximately 1,577,300 $.
 3. Staples recorded the highest product sales, reaching approximately $113,000.
 4. While top-selling products recorded a profit margin of about 11% several low-sales products delivered
    substantially higher margins reaching approximately 26%.

### Recommendations:

To optimize profitability and ensure sustainable growth, the company should adopt a balanced product strategy:

1.Maintain Best-Sellers (High-Volume Products): Continue to promote and stock top-selling items to secure consistent revenue and cash flow.

2.Promote high-profit niche products: Focus on products with lower sales but higher profit margins to increase overall profitability.
